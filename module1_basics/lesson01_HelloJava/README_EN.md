# Lesson 1 — Introduction to Java and Your First Program

In this lesson you will:
- Learn what Java is and why it is popular.
- Understand what a class and the `main` method are.
- Write your first program that prints a message on the screen.
- See how to fix basic compilation errors.

---

### Example Program — `HelloJava01.java`
```java
public class HelloJava01 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is your first program in Java
        // println prints the text and moves to a new line
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Java!
```

---

### Common Mistakes (`HelloJavaErrors.java`)
- Missing semicolon `;` at the end of a statement.  
- Wrong class or file name (they must match).  
- Misspelled `System.out.println`.

---

### Practice Task (`HelloJavaFixTask.java`)
1. Copy the example code into a new file.  
2. Change the text inside quotes to your own greeting.  
3. Add one more line that prints your name.  
4. Save and run your program.
