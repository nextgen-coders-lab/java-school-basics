# Lesson 2 â€” Variables in Java

This lesson introduces the concept of **variables** in Java â€” how to declare, assign, and use them in programs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning goals
- Understand what a variable is  
- Learn main data types: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, `String`  
- Practice assigning and printing variable values  
- Learn to fix common compilation errors

## ðŸ§© Files in this folder

### `Second.java`
A simple example that shows how to declare variables and print them.

### `VariablesErrors.java`
Contains examples of **common beginner mistakes** and the correct versions right next to them.

### `VariablesFixTask.java`
A **practice file with broken code**. Students should find and fix all mistakes so the program compiles and runs correctly.

## ðŸ’¡ Teacherâ€™s note
Encourage students to:
1. Compile each file separately and read compiler errors carefully.  
2. Explain in their own words **why** each fix was needed.  
3. Try changing variable values and adding new ones (e.g., `favoriteColor`, `hobby`).

## ðŸ§  Extra challenge
Ask students to create a new file `VariablesPractice.java` that prints a short introduction about themselves using all five variable types.
