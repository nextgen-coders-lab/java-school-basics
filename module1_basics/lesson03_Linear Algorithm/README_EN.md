# Lesson 3 â€“ Linear Algorithm

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Learn to create a **linear algorithm** â€“ a program that executes commands **step by step**, without conditions or loops.

### ðŸ’¡ What You Will Learn
- Sequential program execution  
- Reading input using `Scanner`  
- Performing simple calculations  
- Printing results to the console

### ðŸ§© Files in this lesson
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `LinearAlgorithmErrors.java` | Compiles but contains logical mistakes (used for discussion). |
| `LinearAlgorithmFixTask.java` | Contains syntax errors that students must fix to make it run. |

---

### ðŸ§  Task for Students
1. Open **`LinearAlgorithmFixTask.java`**.  
2. Try to **compile the program** â€“ find and fix all syntax errors.  
3. After it compiles, **run it** and check if the result is correct.  
4. Improve the final output message to look friendly and clear, for example:  
   ```
   Total cost of apples is 7.5 GEL
   ```

---

### âœ… Hints
- Donâ€™t forget semicolons `;` at the end of statements.  
- Check uppercase/lowercase: `System.out.println` (not `system` or `Println`).  
- `import java.util.Scanner;` must be added before the class declaration.  
- Use `*` for multiplication, not `+` or `^`.  

---

### ðŸ’¬ Example Output
```
Welcome! Let's calculate total cost of apples
Enter price for one apple (use dot, e.g. 1.5): 1.5
Enter number of apples: 5
Total cost is 7.5 GEL
```
